This application demonstrates the results expected for the Inverse Kinematics lab. Play with application and fill the provided skeleton to code the Inverse Kinematics solution.

The application can be controlled using the following keys
	- Up, Down, Left and Right arrows: control the v2D target position (the IK solution is automatically updated)
	- I: Show the alternative IK solution 	
	- Z/A: respectively decrease and increase the length of the first bone (the IK solution is automatically updated)
	- X/S: respectively decrease and increase the length of the second bone (the IK solution is automatically updated)
	- W: switch between polygon and wireframe modes
	
Also, the application include the glm libray (mathematic library). It includes vectors and linear algebra operations (norm, dot and cross products, etc). We advise you to try to use this library if you need to handle vectors and matematical operations.
